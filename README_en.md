## ✈️ Current Development Status and Future Plans
Currently, some pages are hardcoded and do not have placeholders for backend modifications. We will gradually update the backend to support dynamic modifications in the future.  
The initial purpose of this project was to update my personal website and create a simple blog system for publishing articles and design works. My **frontend skills are limited**, so there may be some messy code and bugs. I appreciate your understanding. This project was basically developed while learning.  
If any experts are willing to join me in completing this project, I would be extremely grateful 🙏🏻.
